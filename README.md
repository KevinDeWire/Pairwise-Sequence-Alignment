# Pairwise-Sequence-Alignment

Project 1(A): Implementation of Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm

The program will take two sequences to be aligned as input. A simple scoring scheme will be used in this case. A user should be allowed to enter the parameter for match, mismatch, and gap respectively. The output is the optimal alignment score and the optimal alignment.

This is accomplished with a Java application.  Swing components are used to create a form for the entery of the users data.  The submit button will use the supplied information to calculate the optimal alignment and score.  The score and an optimal alignement are then displayed.
